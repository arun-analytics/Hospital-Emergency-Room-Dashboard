# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

I have recently learned interactive dashboard design from **Satish Dhawale**, where I learned how to analyze hospital emergency room data using Excel.

## Dashboard Highlights:

- 📊 Patient Admission Status: Admitted vs. Not Admitted
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Patient Age Distribution: Grouped by age
- ⏱️ Timeliness: % patients seen within 30 minutes
- 🚻 Gender Analysis: Male vs Female
- 🏥 Department Referrals: Most referred departments

### Tools Used:

- Microsoft Excel (Interactive Dashboard)
- Slicers, PivotTables, Charts, Conditional Formatting
